# NuExercises

-TODO: Add a Readme file that at least includes:
    - runtime versions (e.g. Ruby 2.3)
    - how to install any dependencies
      - In the Gemfile I noted "Gemspec" which lists bundler rake and rspec
      (if they don't have them, then gem install...)
    - how to run your tests from the command line

TODO: Write a gem description


##Installation

Add this to your app's Gemfile:

    gem 'quotator'

Then, execute:

  $bundle

Or install it yourself as:

  $ gem install Quotator
